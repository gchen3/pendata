#2. Benefit assumptions: ----

cola_tier_1_active_ <- 0.03 #COLA for tier 1 active members
cola_tier_2_active_ <- 0 #COLA for tier 2 active members
cola_tier_3_active_ <- 0 #COLA for tier 3 active members

funding_policy_ <- "statutory"              #Plan's funding policy: "statutory" means a fixed contribution rate; "ADC" means an actuarially determined contribution rate. For FRS, this input is irrelevant since the plan's statutory policy is equivalent to its ADC policy.

funding_lag_ <- 1                            #This is the additional time (in years) that it takes for the determined contribution rate to take effect after 1 year. By the default, the contribution rate will take effect one year after it's determined (funding lag = 0).
                                             #If the funding lag is 1, then the contribution rate will take effect 2 years after it's determined.

## Model Calibration ----
